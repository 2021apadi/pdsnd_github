### Project Title
Project 2 -Bike share project

### Description
In the bikeshare project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. A code was written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The developed CLI program allows  to explore an US bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. It is able to filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data. We are able  to view raw data and  sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.
